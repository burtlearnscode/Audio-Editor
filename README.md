# Audio-Editor
Standalone audio editor made with Python
This Python Audio Editor project provides a GUI-based solution for editing audio files. The editor has a range of features, including opening and saving audio files, playing audio, trimming audio, adjusting volume, and applying low-pass and high-pass filters. Users can adjust the frequency of the low-pass and high-pass filters using sliders that range from 20Hz to 10,000Hz. The editor uses the PyDub and Simpleaudio libraries to manage audio data and playback.

This is one of my first projects and definately needs some work so I thought it'd be an excellent opportunity for developers interested in working with audio processing and GUI development. Collaborators can help to improve and expand the existing functionality of the editor by adding new features, optimizing code, improving the user interface, and fixing any bugs. There are several ways for developers to get involved, such as:

Adding support for additional audio file formats
Implementing a new feature such as noise reduction or audio equalization
Creating a more intuitive user interface or improving existing UI elements
Optimizing the code to improve performance
Adding more options for the user to customize the filters
This project is perfect for developers who want to contribute to an open-source project, improve their Python skills, and gain experience in audio processing and GUI development. Collaborating on this project will provide an excellent opportunity for developers to learn from one another, share knowledge, and work on a real-world project.
